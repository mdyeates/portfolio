# Portfolio
## Description

A website development portfolio I created for a bootcamp assignment using HTML and CSS. The various sections use both flexbox and grid. I will replace the placeholder images and text once I have developed some applications to talk about. 

* This page presents my name, a photo and links to sections about me, my work and a contact form
* As the links are clicked, the UI scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section
* The work section contains titled placeholder images for my future applications
* A larger image is displayed for the main application
* My sections include icons, links, and images that use hover and transition functions
* The application images are clickable (currently takes you to my github repo) and will take you to the deployed application when I have created them
* I have used media queries to ensure compatibility with a number of different devices
