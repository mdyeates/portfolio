# Portfolio
## Description

To showcase my skills and talents to potential employers, I have built this portfolio website. In this portfolio, I will highlight my strongest projects as well as the thought processes that went into them. At the moment, it has placeholder images and text that I will replace once I have completed the projects I wish to showcase. 

In order to complete this project, I used recent skills I learned about Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries. I implemented hover animations in the navigation bar, my project image tiles, the contact form, and the footer. To improve user experience, I added smooth scrolling when the navigation links are clicked.

Summary:

* This page presents my name, a photo and links to sections about me, my work and a contact form
* As the links are clicked, the UI scrolls smoothly to the corresponding section
* The work section contains titled placeholder images for my future applications
* A larger image is displayed for the main application
* My sections include icons, links, and images that use hover and transition functions
* The application images are clickable (currently takes you to my github repo) and will take you to the deployed application when I have created them
* I have used media queries to ensure compatibility with a number of different devices

## Usage

Users can access this website from a variety of devices. In order to ensure that the layout is compatible with smaller devices such as smartphones and tablets, I have used media queries.
